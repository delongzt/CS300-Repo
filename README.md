Problem Overview
In this course, the primary problem I was solving involved creating software solutions that effectively manage and manipulate data through the use of various data structures. The projects focused on implementing structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues to develop efficient, reliable systems that can handle real-world scenarios, such as managing inventories, organizing tasks, and processing user inputs.

Approach to Problem-Solving
I approached each problem by first analyzing the requirements and determining which data structures would be best suited for the given tasks. Understanding data structures was essential because they provide the foundation for building programs that are optimized for performance and can efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data. I also used UML diagrams to visualize how the data would flow and interact within the system.

Overcoming Roadblocks
I encountered some roadblocks, particularly when implementing more complex structures like trees and hash maps. To overcome these challenges, I reviewed course materials, consulted external resources, and experimented with different coding techniques. I also relied on debugging tools and carefully tested individual components to ensure that the program was functioning correctly at each step.

Expanding Software Design Approach
This project has expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of selecting the right data structure for each problem. It taught me to think more critically about data organization and how it impacts the overall efficiency and scalability of the system. I also learned to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts, which made the development process more structured.

Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
My work on this project has significantly improved how I write code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I have incorporated better naming conventions, modular coding practices, and detailed comments throughout the codebase. I also focused on creating functions that can be easily reused and adapted for different scenarios, making the programs easier to update and expand in the future.
